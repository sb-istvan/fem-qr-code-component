## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS Variables (for colors)
- Flexbox

### What I learned

I started using Frontend Mentor with this really basic challenge to see how the ecosystem works. The instructions are clear and easy to follow. However I set the font size of the paragraph is to 15.5px because the 15px of the Style Guide looked smaller than on the reference design screenshot.

This is also my first GitHub repository. Exciting times!

### Continued development

As there were only a few elements in the HTML code I selected them directly in CSS without using classes or IDs. Can't wait to build something more complex!

### Useful resources

- [Tailwind CSS - Drop Shadow](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/drop-shadow) - I got the shadow effect from here.
